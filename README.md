Please refer to this page's wiki for the documentations (including app overview & screenshots).

An RSS Feed app created using Android Studio. Features:

1. Real-time news update from listed news sources
2. Personalize news sources by choosing from existing news sources
3. Add custom news source from adding your own RSS source
4. Share to social media (Twitter & Facebook API)
5. Easy to use UI

To run the app, simply open a new project using Android Studio, then build and run the app, either directly on phone or using emulator (we used Google Pixel 2 for the screenshots).
