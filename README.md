# Android RSS Feed App

An RSS Feed app created using Android Studio as part of course assignment

To run the app, simply open a new project using Android Studio, then build and run the app, either directly on phone or using emulator (we used Google Pixel 2 for the screenshots).

Please refer to this page's wiki for the documentations (including app overview & screenshots).
